title: Installing Go programs directly
---

_By [Daniel Mart√≠](https://mvdan.cc), contributor to Go, maintainer of
[`encoding/json`](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json), and tool author._

_Note: this is a preview of a `cmd/go` feature that is due to land in Go 1.16_

Users need a simple, easy-to-remember way to install Go programs. Similarly, tool authors need a short one-liner they
can include at the top of their `README.md` explaining how to install the tool.

Go 1.16 introduces a new way to install Go programs directly with the `go` command. This guide
introduces the new mode of `go install` using the example of
[`honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/), and is suitable for both end users and tool authors.

### Prerequisites

You should already have completed:

* [The Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/)
* [An introduction to play-with-go.dev guides](/intro-to-play-with-go-dev/)
* [Tutorial: Get started with Go](/get-started-with-go/)
* [Installing Go](/installing-go_go115_en)

This guide is running with:

```.term1
$ go version
go version devel +7307e86afd Sun Nov 8 12:19:55 2020 +0000 linux/amd64
```
{:data-command-src="Z28gdmVyc2lvbgo="}

### Background

Currently, tool authors who want to provide installation instructions in their projects' `README.md` typically include:

```.term1
$ go get honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck
go: downloading honnef.co/go/tools v0.0.1-2020.1.6
go: downloading golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20200410194907-79a7a3126eef
go: downloading golang.org/x/xerrors v0.0.0-20191204190536-9bdfabe68543
go: downloading github.com/BurntSushi/toml v0.3.1
```
{:data-command-src="Z28gZ2V0IGhvbm5lZi5jby9nby90b29scy9jbWQvc3RhdGljY2hlY2sK"}

There are a number of problems with this approach:

* A user might run the above `go get` within a module, which would
  update the current module's dependencies, rather than just installing the tool directly.
* `go get` might not be running in module mode at all, for example
  if the user previously modified `GO111MODULE`.
* The use of `go get` is confusing; it is used to download and install executables,
  but it's also responsible for managing dependencies in `go.mod` files.

Prior to Go 1.16, the general advice to fix the first two problems was to use a snippet
which runs `go get` in module mode and outside any module, by using a temporary directory:

```.term1
$ (cd $(mktemp -d); GO111MODULE=on go get honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.0.1-2020.1.6)
```
{:data-command-src="KGNkICQobWt0ZW1wIC1kKTsgR08xMTFNT0RVTEU9b24gZ28gZ2V0IGhvbm5lZi5jby9nby90b29scy9jbWQvc3RhdGljY2hlY2tAdjAuMC4xLTIwMjAuMS42KQo="}

However, this new approach had its own problems:

* It's not user-friendly; the extra shell is confusing to newcomers, and hard to remember.
* It's not cross platform; the command is not guaranteed to work on Windows.

It is clear that neither method is satisfactory, especially for `README.md`
instructions which are meant to be brief and easy to follow.

### `go install` in Go 1.16

In Go 1.16, the `go install` command is now used to install programs directly, i.e. regardless of the current
module context:

```.term1
$ go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.0.1-2020.1.6
```
{:data-command-src="Z28gaW5zdGFsbCBob25uZWYuY28vZ28vdG9vbHMvY21kL3N0YXRpY2NoZWNrQHYwLjAuMS0yMDIwLjEuNgo="}

For the purposes of this guide you are using a specific version (`v0.0.1-2020.1.6`). Alternatively,
the special `latest` version can be used to install the latest release.

Much like the previous behaviour of `go get`, `go install` places binaries in `$GOPATH/bin`,
or in `$GOBIN` if set. See the _"Setting up your `PATH`"_ section in [Installing Go](/installing-go_go115_en) to ensure
your `PATH` is set correctly.

Verify that `staticcheck` is now on your `PATH`:

```.term1
$ which staticcheck
/home/gopher/go/bin/staticcheck
```
{:data-command-src="d2hpY2ggc3RhdGljY2hlY2sK"}

Run `staticcheck` to check everything is working:

```.term1
$ staticcheck -version
staticcheck 2020.1.6
```
{:data-command-src="c3RhdGljY2hlY2sgLXZlcnNpb24K"}

You can also use `go version` to see the module dependencies used in building the program:

```.term1
$ go version -m $(which staticcheck)
/home/gopher/go/bin/staticcheck: devel +7307e86afd Sun Nov 8 12:19:55 2020 +0000
	path	honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck
	mod	honnef.co/go/tools	v0.0.1-2020.1.6	h1:W18jzjh8mfPez+AwGLxmOImucz/IFjpNlrKVnaj2YVc=
	dep	github.com/BurntSushi/toml	v0.3.1	h1:WXkYYl6Yr3qBf1K79EBnL4mak0OimBfB0XUf9Vl28OQ=
	dep	golang.org/x/tools	v0.0.0-20200410194907-79a7a3126eef	h1:RHORRhs540cYZYrzgU2CPUyykkwZM78hGdzocOo9P8A=
	dep	golang.org/x/xerrors	v0.0.0-20191204190536-9bdfabe68543	h1:E7g+9GITq07hpfrRu66IVDexMakfv52eLZ2CXBWiKr4=
```
{:data-command-src="Z28gdmVyc2lvbiAtbSAkKHdoaWNoIHN0YXRpY2NoZWNrKQo="}

To eliminate redundancy and confusion, using `go get` to build or
install programs is being deprecated in Go 1.16.

### Conclusion

That's it! Time to sit back and wait for the release of Go 1.16!
