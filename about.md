<h1>Play with Go</h1>

<p><a href="https://play-with-go.dev/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">play-with-go.dev</code></a> is a series of
hands-on, interactive, browser-based guides that introduce the tools required to work with <a
href="https://golang.org/">the Go programming language</a>. It is the natural next step after <a
href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">“A Tour of Go”</a> which introduces the language itself. <code
class="highlighter-rouge">play-with-go.dev</code> covers the various subcommands of the <code
class="highlighter-rouge">go</code> command, <a href="https://staticcheck.io/"><code
class="highlighter-rouge">staticcheck</code></a> and many other tools that will make writing Go programs that much
easier and fun!</p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">play-with-go.dev</code> was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/_myitcv">Paul Jolly</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/marcosnils">Marcos
Nils</a>. Guides are built using the popular
<a href="https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker"><code class="highlighter-rouge">play-with-docker</code></a> platform (created by <a href="https://twitter.com/marcosnils">Marcos
Nils</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/xetorthio">Jonathan Leibiusky</a>). Guides are served via
https://play-with-go.dev/ and run in a user’s browser, presenting the guide content on the left, and an interactive
terminal on the right. This terminal is connected to a remote session hosted in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google’s
Cloud</a>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">play-with-go.dev</code> is an experiment designed to test the hypothesis that interactive guides are a more engaging medium
for learning when it comes to developer tools. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">go</code> command and modules lend themselves very well to this type of
guide therefore.</p>
