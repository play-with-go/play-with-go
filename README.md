## [`play-with-go.dev`](https://play-with-go.dev/)

[`play-with-go.dev`](https://play-with-go.dev/) is a series of hands-on, interactive, browser-based guides that
introduce the tools required to work with [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/). It is the natural next
step after ["A Tour of Go"](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) which introduces the language itself. `play-with-go.dev`
covers the various subcommands of the `go` command, [`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/) and many other tools that
will make writing Go programs that much easier and fun!

### About

`play-with-go.dev` guides are built using the popular
[`play-with-docker`](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker) platform. Guides are served via
https://play-with-go.dev/ and run in a user's browser, presenting the guide content on the left, and an interactive
terminal on the right. This terminal is connected to a remote session hosted in [Google's
Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). As the reader works through a guide, clicking on command blocks cause those commands
to be executed on the remote session. Similarly, clicking on file contents causes those file contents to be uploaded.
The reader can also run commands or make changes to files themselves.
