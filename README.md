## [`play-with-go.dev`](https://play-with-go.dev/)

[`play-with-go.dev`](https://play-with-go.dev/) is a series of hands-on, interactive, browser-based guides that
introduce the tools required to work with [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/). It is the natural next
step after ["A Tour of Go"](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) which introduces the language itself. `play-with-go.dev`
covers the various subcommands of the `go` command, [`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/) and many other tools that
will make writing Go programs that much easier and fun!

### About

`play-with-go.dev` was created by [Paul Jolly](https://twitter.com/_myitcv) and [Marcos
Nils](https://twitter.com/marcosnils). Guides are built using the popular
[`play-with-docker`](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker) platform (created by [Marcos
Nils](https://twitter.com/marcosnils) and [Jonathan Leibiusky](https://twitter.com/xetorthio)). Guides are served via
https://play-with-go.dev/ and run in a user's browser, presenting the guide content on the left, and an interactive
terminal on the right. This terminal is connected to a remote session hosted in [Google's
Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

`play-with-go.dev` is an experiment designed to test the hypothesis that interactive guides are a more engaging medium
for learning when it comes to developer tools. The `go` command and modules lend themselves very well to this type of
guide therefore.
